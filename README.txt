Welcome to my FIFA Squad Builder Application!
I built it for fun since I love FIFA.
Try it out and let me know what you think!

|------------------------------------------------------------
|How to get started:
|------------------------------------------------------------
|Extract 'FIFA APP.tar.gz' and open 'FIFA Squad Builder' to get started!
|All files needed should be included, but it might require one or two things.
|------------------------------------------------------------


|------------------------------------------------------------
|Some things to note:
|------------------------------------------------------------
|The nice looking images belong to EA Sports.
|
|Before doing ultimate team creation, read the notes about
|the limitations in its respective section below.
|
|This is very, very unrefined and has lots of bugs.
|Hence, don't click too fast and only type in boxes.
|If it seems like it might have crashed, it probably did.
|If it crashes, just restart.
|
|Ultimate team creation is a very extensive process!
|Just having 5 players in each position gives 48,828,125
|different possible combinations! Please limit the size of
|your player list, or use the limitations provided or it will
|go on forever!
|
|If you delete all of your files from the file menu, there is
|a bug currently and you won't be able to go back.
|Just restart and create a new list.
|
|Prices are retrieved from www.futbin.com
|
|I haven't finished filling out the formation styles or
|descriptions yet. So ignore the temporary information.
|
|Again, it is a work in progress with lots of bugs. Just try
|it out, have a little fun, and give me any suggestions of
|things to add/improve. I have a big list, but I don't mind
|adding to it.

|------------------------------------------------------------
|!!!Instructions!!!
|------------------------------------------------------------
|Let me try to explain how to use this mess.
|
|Start the program: click on 'FIFA Squad Builder.exe'
|
|There are 3 sections:
|'Search': From this section you can search the currently
|          player databases, player lists, formation
|          databases, formation lists, and team lists.
|          Essentially, this is where you view everything.
|
|'Teams':  From this section you can set up and run the
|          ultimate team creation.
|
|'Files':  From this section you can select/create/edit/delete
|          the player database, player lists, formation
|          database, formation lists, and team lists.
|
|The difference between databases and lists:
|Databases contain all possible data and should not be edited.
|Lists are subsets of databases and can be edited and are used
|for team creation or whatever you want smaller lists for.
|
|------------------------------------------------------------
|
|'Search' Section!
|When you click on the 'Search' button it opens a window with
|a lot more buttons. Don't panic! Let me explain.
|
|Start: Starts the search with the selected options.
|Back: Returns to the first menu of the program.
|Players/Formations/Teams: These are more like tabs than buttons.
|     Click these to switch between the three.
|Add Search Attribute: Opens a menu to select options to specify
|     what to search for.
|Add Sort Attribute: Opens a menu to select options to specify
|     how to sort the players/formations/teams that are found.
|Reset Results: Deletes the selected options and removes the
|     search results from the page.
|Database: The two radio buttons represent the selected database
|     on the left, and the selected list on the right. Select
|     which one you want to search.
|Sort Order: Select how you want to the results to be shown.
|     Descending (the default) starts with higher values and
|     ascending starts with lower values first.
|
|That's it! Try them out! This is just searching so none of those
|buttons will affect anything!
|
|
|Adding search attributes:
|Click the 'Add Search Attributes' button.
|Select the radio button of the attribute you want to search by.
|In the text box below, enter the value you want to search by.
|Above the text box select the modifiers of how the value should
|be used. Note: the modifiers do not work for all traits. When
|in doubt, try it out. If it doesn't work, it won't matter which
|one you pick.
|Click 'Enter' and the search attribute will be displayed to the
|side of the buttons near the bottom.
|Click on the displayed attributes on the sides at the bottom to
|remove them.
|When finished, click the 'Back' button.
|The 'Erase List' button deletes all the selected attributes.
|
|Notes:
|Player search attributes:
|If the attribute has a question mark (?) then the value should
|be 'True' or 'False'. To select these you can input either
|'True', 'T', 'False', 'F', 'Yes', 'Y', 'No', or 'N' with any
|capitalization.
|'Birth Date' should be searched with the format YYYY/MM/DD.
|It doesn't matter what symbol is used between the numbers.
|If you use a non number for the YYYY, it will search all years.
|If you use a non number for the MM or DD, it will crash.
|'Weight' uses kilograms if a value of 110 or lower is entered.
|If a higher value is entered, it will assume it is pounds and
|convert it to kilograms.
|'Height' uses feet if a value below 10 is entered and it will
|convert it to centimeters.
|If a value of 10 or higher is entered, it will assume centimeters.
|'Traits' accepts parts of the trait names, and multiple can
|be entered if separated by a comma. Ex: "long shot, dribbler".
|'Club' includes the abbreviations. Ex: ESP 1, GER 1, MLS
|'Name - Any Part' is my custom name search. All of the other
|name searches are for specific parts of the name. My custom
|name search checks all parts of the player's name.
|
|Formation search attributes:
|'Name' searches for the names of the formations like '4-4-2'
|'Position' searches for the position abbreviations.
|Ex.: LF, RF, ST, CF, LW, RW, LM, RM, CM, CAM, CDM, LWB, RWB,
|LB, RB, CB, GK.
|
|Team search attributes:
|'Strength' is a custom attribute I came up with that was
|supposed to try to take into account special characteristics
|of players such as skill moves, weak foot, really good
|individual traits, etc. However it isn't very refined right
|now and I might delete it. Search using a number value.
|'Total Individual Chemistry' goes up to 110 instead of 100
|because it doesn't round down. It is useful to know if every
|player is a 10 individual chemistry or not.
|'Player' searches for specific players being on the team or
|not. Enter part of a player's name.
|'Manager League' and 'Manager Nation' are the assigned
|suggested league/nation for the team's manager.
|
|
|Adding sort attributes:
|Exactly the same as adding search attributes except easier!
|Just click on the attribute button and that's it.
|
|
|Searching:
|When all of the options are set up, click the 'Start' button!
|If searching on a large set of data (the players) it might
|take a couple seconds.
|The buttons shown with the player name, formation name, or
|team rating, takes you to a more detailed page of the player,
|formation, or team.
|The '<<< Previous 20' and 'Next 20 >>>' takes you to the
|previous or next page of results. The GUI didn't allow for
|just having a scroll window... not that I found at least.
|The 'Add All' or 'Remove All' buttons either add all the
|players or formations to the current selected list, or removes
|them from the currently selected list. If you do it by mistake,
|you can immediately add it back by clicking it again. This
|button does affect the files, so be careful or you might delete
|your whole list.
|
|
|In Detail Player Window:
|'Add Player to List' and 'Remove Player from List' performs
|the respective action on the current player on the current list.
|'Back' button returns to the previous page.
|'Update' button updates the price of the player.
|The add/remove player and update button only currently work from
|the search page, and not when click on the player from the team
|page.
|
|In Detail Formation Window:
|Same as the Player window except no update button.
|
|In Detail Team Window:
|The most exciting window!
|'Back' button returns to the previous page.
|'Picture' button is the default display with the player pictures.
|Clicking on the player's name button takes you to the detailed
|player page.
|'Stat Summary' button displays the summary stats, weak foot,
|skill moves, and price of the players.
|'Strengths' displays the 6 highest rated attributes of the players.
|'Traits' displays five of the player's traits, if any.
|'Specialities' displays five of the player's specialities, if any.
|'Team/League/Nation' displays those 3 field of the players. I put
|this here to more easily look at chemistry links.
|'Chemistry' displays the chemistry breakdown of all of the players
|and shows roughly how it is calculated. The link lines are also
|shown slightly more prominently in case they were difficult to
|see because of players being closely organized.
|
|------------------------------------------------------------
|
|'Teams' Section!
|When you click on the 'Teams' button it opens a window with
|three buttons.
|
|Create Ultimate Teams: Opens the ultimate team creation window.
|    Generates teams based on the player list and formation list.
|Manually Create Teams: Opens the formation selection window.
|    Select players and formations to generate teams using.
|Back: Returns to the first menu of the program.
|
|Formation Selection Window:
|Select one of the formations to create teams using. Or select
|the formations list button at the bottom to use all of the
|formations on the list. Selecting one of the options with open
|the Assign Player Window.
|
|Assign Player Window:
|If a specific formation was selected, each position is represented
|on the field diagram. From here a player can be selected for each
|position for as many players as desired. The remaining players will
|be generated automatically. If the formation list was selected
|instead of a formation, 11 spots are lined up. Players can be assigned
|to any of these spots, position doesn't matter, and a team will be
|generated using them. Clicking next opens the ultimate team creation
|window where the team creation is kicked off using the selected
|players and formation(s).
|
|Ultimate Team Creation Window:
|'Player List' is the currently selected player list. These are
|the players that will be used to create the teams. Click on
|the button to select a different list.
|'Formation List' is the currently selected formation list.
|These are the formations that will be used to create the teams.
|Click on the button to select a different list.
|'Team List Name' is the name the team list will be given when
|created.
|'Processing Type' decides whether the program will use only
|one process or the max number of processes. Currently there is
|no in between. WARNING! If you use the 'Multi' option it will
|max out your CPU!!! It will get hot if you don't have a good
|fan! Your computer will also run very slowly! Currently there
|is not a cancel button so if you want to quit in the middle
|use the Task Manager and end all of the program processes!
|On the positive side, 'Multi' is several times faster than
|'Single' if you are creating teams for multiple formations.
|'Chemistry Matters': If 'Yes' it will try to create teams
|with 100 chemistry. If 'No' it will try to place players in
|positions somewhat related to theirs, but will not check for
|good links with other players.
|'How to Judge Teams' lets you select how to sort the teams
|when the top ones to return are selected. Same as picking
|sort attributes for teams on the search menu.
|'How to Judge Players' lets you select how to sort the players
|when the top ones to use are selected. Same as picking
|sort attributes for players on the search menu.
|
|Limitations!!! Use these so it doesn't run forever!!!
|'Players per Position' is how many players it tries (at most)
|at each position. Remember 5 players per position is
|48,828,125 different teams!!! However, if you limit too much,
|good combinations will be missed out on!
|'Max Teams per Formation' is how many valid teams will be checked
|(at most) for each formation.
|'Max Teams to Return' is how many teams will be returned and
|saved. WARNING! About 250 teams is approximately 13 MB of data!
|If this number is too high, it will use up all of the memory on
|your computer and crash the program! I think I crashed around
|30,000 teams maybe. I don't advise that. That would be a team
|file size of around 1.5 GB.
|'Time Limit' sets a time limit of how long the program will run.
|The time can be set using days, hours, or minutes.
|
|Any of these limitations can be enabled and disabled by clicking
|on their button.
|
|'Start' will start the team creation. Currently I don't have a
|status window for this process so it will seem to just freeze
|until completed. Please use limitations or a small player list
|or this will go on for a long, long time. When completed it will
|unfreeze and the 'Team List Name' field will be cleared.
|'Back' will return to the previous screen.
|
|------------------------------------------------------------
|
|'Files' Section!
|When you click on the 'Files' button it opens a window with
|a lot more buttons. Again, don't panic! Let me explain, again.
|
|The 'Lists', 'Databases', and 'Defaults' buttons below the title
|are like tabs for selecting those respective categories.
|'Lists' are the smaller groups of players and formations used for
|team creation or whatever you want to use them for.
|'Databases' are the full sets of players and formations and should
|not really be changed except updated.
|'Defaults' are the files that are loaded automatically when the
|program starts. That is all.
|'Back' will return to the previous screen.
|
|'Create New List' button will open a new window to create a new
|list of any type. See the section below.
|
|'Download Player DB' will download an updated player list from the
|EA Sports website. See the section below.
|
|All of the remaining buttons are for selecting the list or database
|for each respective category. When any of these are selected, a new
|window is opened with more buttons! The buttons with the file name
|will select that file for that category and load it. 'Rename' will
|let the file be renamed. 'Edit' allows players and formations to be
|added/removed from their lists. See the section below.
|'Update Prices' retrieves updated prices for the selected list
|or database. It uses the same status window as downloading a new
|player database. 'Duplicate' creates a copy of the list or database.
|'Delete' will delete the list or database.
|
|'Create New List'
|When the button is clicked, a new window opens. Select the type of
|list to create and enter a file name.
|For a player list, then enter a player's rating and name
|(Ex. 99 Messi) or just the player's name. If there is only one
|result, the player is immediately added. If there is more than
|one, the players are listed and can be selected by clicking the
|'Add' button. Clicking the 'Undo Add' button will remove the
|last player added. Click 'Done' to finish and return to the previous
|page.
|For a formation list, it is the same as a player list except just
|enter the whole or a part of the formations name. Or enter nothing
|to get the full list.
|Currently creating a team list just creates a blank list.
|
|'Download Player DB'
|When the button is clicked, a new window opens. Enter the new
|database name and select whether to get prices or not. Currently
|it gets all prices. In the future I plan to implement options to
|try to only get prices that aren't bottomed out. WARNING! Getting
|prices takes a long time because it has to make multiple queries
|for every single player! Clicking 'Enter' opens the status window
|and the download starts. To get an update on the progress of the
|download, click the 'Current Status' button. Click 'Stop' to stop
|the process. If you close the program without clicking 'Stop', it
|will keep running in the background until it finishes. Click 'Back'
|to go back to the previous window. It appears after clicking 'Stop'
|or after it finishes and 'Current Status' is clicked.
|
|'Edit'
|Allows the current list to be edited. When this button is clicked,
|a new window is opened. It is another search window to find
|players or formations to add or remove from the list based on the
|currently selected database. Select the add radio button to search
|the selected database for players/formations to add. Select the
|edit/delete radio button to search the currently selected list for
|players or formations to remove. The 'Simple' button is selected
|by default and allows searching based on rating and/or name. The
|'Advanced' button allows for searching using the same methods as
|the search menu. Almost everything is the same as the search
|menu except for a couple key differences. When players or
|formations are displayed they also have a small '+' or '-' button.
|Clicking this button will either add it (+) or remove it (-)
|from the current list being edited. Sometimes this gets a little
|mixed up and not updated if you add/remove the player from the
|detailed player page and then go back to this edit page. The
|only other difference from the search page is when 'Edit/Delete
|Players' is selected. The players position is displayed as a button.
|When this button is clicked it opens a new window allowing the
|user to select a new position for the player. It currently
|has no restrictions and a striker can become a goalkeeper.
|Warning! Changing a player's position currently makes it so
|the price can't be retrieved and some other small complications.
